# Malaria Detection from Microscopic Blood Cell Images

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite that infects mosquitoes and then humans through mosquito bites. It affects millions of people worldwide,
primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is crucial for effective treatment and prevention of complications. 

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically detect the presence of malaria parasites in microscopic blood cell images. Early detection
through automated analysis can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of diagnosis, making a real impact on public health.

## Dataset

This project utilizes a publicly available dataset originally sourced from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website. The dataset contains 27,558 images of
microscopic blood cells, organized into two folders:

• Infected: This folder contains images of blood cells infected with malaria parasites.

• Uninfected: This folder contains images of blood cells without any parasitic infection.



## CNN Approach

Convolutional Neural Networks are powerful deep learning models particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks. The CNN architecture used in this project is specifically designed to extract relevant features from the blood cell images. By analyzing the patterns and characteristics within these images, the model learns to identify the presence of malaria parasites with high accuracy. 

## Results
The model achieved a F1-Score above 94%. This demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs for malaria detection, paving the way for developing robust automated diagnostic tools for this important public health issue.
